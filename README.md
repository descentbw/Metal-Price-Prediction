Prediction of prices of the rare earth element Neodymium using Bidirectional Long-Short Term

Data on monthly electric vehicle sales, monthly wind energy generation by OECD countries, and daily stock prices of both Chinese and non-Chinese neodymium mining companies, were used to predict 5-days ahead stock prices of Neodymium.

A BiLSTM model was chosen in this prediction due to its ability to handle sequential data and consideration of both the past and future context in its predictions.

The results show that such variables are relevant in the prediction of Neodymium prices.
